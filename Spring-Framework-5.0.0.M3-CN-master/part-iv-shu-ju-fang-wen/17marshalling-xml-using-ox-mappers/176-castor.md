## 17.6Â Castor

Castor XML mapping is an open source XML binding framework. It allows you to transform the data contained in a java object model into/from an XML document. By default, it does not require any further configuration, though a mapping file can be used to have more control over the behavior of Castor.

For more information on Castor, refer to the[_Castor web site_](https://castor-data-binding.github.io/castor). The Spring integration classes reside in the`org.springframework.oxm.castor`package.
