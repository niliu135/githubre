## 17.7Â JiBX

The JiBX framework offers a solution similar to that which Hibernate provides for ORM: a binding definition defines the rules for how your Java objects are converted to or from XML. After preparing the binding and compiling the classes, a JiBX binding compiler enhances the class files, and adds code to handle converting instances of the classes from or to XML.

For more information on JiBX, refer to the[_JiBX web site_](http://jibx.sourceforge.net/). The Spring integration classes reside in the`org.springframework.oxm.jibx`package.
