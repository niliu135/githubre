### 13.2.2Â Local transactions

Local transactions are resource-specific, such as a transaction associated with a JDBC connection. Local transactions may be easier to use, but have significant disadvantages: they cannot work across multiple transactional resources. For example, code that manages transactions using a JDBC connection cannot run within a global JTA transaction. Because the application server is not involved in transaction management, it cannot help ensure correctness across multiple resources. \(It is worth noting that most applications use a single transaction resource.\) Another downside is that local transactions are invasive to the programming model.
